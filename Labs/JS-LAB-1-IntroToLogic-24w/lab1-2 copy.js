//#### LAB 1.2 OPERATORS WITH VARIABLES AT A RESTAURANT ####

//ALL VARIABLES ARE DECLARED HERE
var item1 = 9.99; //CHICKEN PASTA
var item2 = 14.50; //STEAK
var item3 = 7.85; //GARLIC BREAD
var subTotal; //TOTAL OF BILL BEFORE DISCOUNT AND TAX
var discountValu = 5; //FIVE BUCKS OFF COUPON
var subAfterDiscount;  //TOTAL AFTER COUPON AND BEFORE TAX
var taxHST = 1.13;  //HST
var totalAfterTax; //TOTAL AFTER TAX
var numOfDiners = 2;//NUMBER OF PEOPLE AT A TABLE
var eachPays; //TOTAL FOR EACH CUSTOMER (TWO CUSTOMERS)
var billMessage = "You each owe $";  //OUTPUT MESSAGE FOR ALERT BOX

//VVVVVVV   LOGIC PROGRAMMING GOES AFTER VARIABLE DECLARATIONS   VVVVVVVVV

//=============== START YOUR LAB WORK DOWN HERE, NOT UP WHERE THE VARIABLES ARE DECLARED.
//Here's the first line of logic...
subTotal = item1 + item2 + item3;

//Next, use the subAfterDiscount variable to subtract the discountValu from the subTotal...
subAfterDiscount = subTotal - discountValu;

//Now, multiply subAfterDiscount by the taxHST to get totalAfterTax...
totalAfterTax = subAfterDiscount * taxHST;

//To get the total for each customer, use eachPays to hold the totalAfterTax divided by the numOfDiners...
eachPays = totalAfterTax / numOfDiners;
eachPays = eachPays.toFixed(2);

//Finally, output a popup that shows the billMessage concatenated (+) with what each customer pays...
alert(billMessage +eachPays);
